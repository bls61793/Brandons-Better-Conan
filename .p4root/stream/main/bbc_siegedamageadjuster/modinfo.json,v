	"description": "BETA-0.9.0\nPlease send all feedback to me on steam at The 7th Crest, or on Discord at The 7th Crest#9918.\nCheck out the Mod Discord: https://discord.gg/bzx3nGpz\n\nThis mod is intended to give server owners granular control over the damage done by siege weapons such as Jars, Trebuchets, Orbs, and Special Ammunition.\n\nThis mod",
	"changeNote": "-Added damage variables for Jars and for the fire damage effects.\n-Changed all siege weapon damage  variables except for explosive arrows base damage and trebuchet damage to 1/10 of their Vanilla values. Explosive arrows only do 2-10 damage, so they were left alone. However, the orb effects created by the arrows use the new damage values--which still reduces the overall damage a pair of Explosive + Poison arrows can do..\n-NOTE: Server Settings Menu is still not set up in Version 0.9.0, so the damage values in 0.9.0 are changed, but CANNOT be edited by server owners in the server settings yet (this is an intended fature for 1.0).  I am releasing it on Steam for my server \"Better Conan\" (a publicly accessible, fair-play PvP server). This mod will be updated fairly frequently ver until 1.0 so be careful using this mod if you don't wanna reset your server regularly.",
